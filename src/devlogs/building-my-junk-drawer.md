So I decided to rebuild my personal website,  ~~because apparently I don't have enough stress in my life~~ because I missed having a personal project where I could break things without consequences.

## Research

I started looking into 'lightweight custom websites' because WordPress kept giving me headaches, and Webflow costs more than my miniature painting — which is saying something.

After a few days of research and too many browser tabs, I landed on Vite, React, and TailwindCSS. Not because I'm particularly smart, but because people on Reddit said it was good, and my Asperger's recognized the pattern.

## Theme

Then I had to decide how this thing should look. I wanted something that actually felt like me, not some Canva or Wix template everyone and their aunt uses.

The last few months, I had fallen back in love with pixel art. Maybe it was nostalgia, maybe it was the simplicity. Either way, I found myself leaning into a 16-bit aesthetic that felt right.

I settled on this arcade-ish retro vibe that makes my website look like it could run on a SNES. It's not trendy persé, and not even that minimalist, but it feels like me, and that's what matters.

## Current Status

So here I am, building what is basically a digital junk drawer. A place for all my projects, thoughts, and whatever else I feel like sharing.

The site is coming together, though not as quickly as I'd like. But it's mine, built from scratch, and I'm actually kind of proud of it.

Is it perfect? Nope. Is it done? Also no. But it's better than paying for something that doesn't feel like me.
