## The Visual Addiction Kicks In

I'm definitely one of those devs who needs to *see* things to build them properly. Reading documentation and planning architectures in my head? Absolutely not happening. Give me a visual feedback loop and watch me iterate myself into oblivion.

Enter Expo Go, which has basically become my new best friend and worst enemy. The ability to make a change, save, and immediately see it update on my phone is incredible. It's also incredibly dangerous because now I find myself tweaking button padding at 1 AM thinking "just one more pixel to the left..."

## Starting with What I Know (Sort Of)

I decided to tackle the journal screen first, partly because I had a clear mental picture from one of the mood tracking apps I'd been using. The basics are pretty straightforward - some text input, maybe a few quick mood selectors, nothing revolutionary.

Of course, I told myself I wasn't going to copy it exactly. I was going to make it *better* and *more unique*. But let's be honest, when you're staring at a blank React Native screen at midnight, "similar but better" feels like a pretty solid starting point.

## The Iteration Trap

The problem with instant visual feedback is that it enables my worst perfectionist tendencies. What should have been a quick "get the basic layout working" session turned into three hours of me adjusting margins and debating whether the input field should have rounded corners or not.

But hey, at least it's starting to look like a real app instead of the default Expo template. Small victories, right?

## Testing Ground

The plan is to get this journal screen feeling solid, then let myself (and maybe some brave friends) actually use it for a while. No point in building features that sound good in theory but feel terrible in practice. The real test will be whether I actually want to open this thing every day, or if it'll join the graveyard of "productivity apps I built but never used."

Knowing my track record, it could go either way.
