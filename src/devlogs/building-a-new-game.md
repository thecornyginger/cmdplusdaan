Welp, I've gone and started yet another project. Because apparently finishing games is overrated and my brain just wants the dopamine hit of new ideas.

I'm calling this one "Tiny Survival" (very original, I know). The name might change later, but who am I kidding? I never rename projects.

For art, I'm using Pixel Frog's Tiny Swords asset pack because my own pixel art skills are... let's just say "developing." These assets are seriously gorgeous though - way better than anything I could make right now.

## The Game Concept

The basic idea is pretty simple:
- Stranded on island (original, I know)
- Need to repair bridge to progress
- Need wood to repair bridge
- Need to chop trees for wood

But here's my twist - as you harvest resources, the island gets depleted, which angers the local inhabitants. Eventually they attack, forcing you to build defenses with the resources you've collected.

So it starts as survival, then morphs into tower defense-ish gameplay. At least that's the plan. We'll see if I actually make it that far.

I've sketched out the map above (well, thrown together the assets to look pretty for a screenshot). My actual planning sketch looks more like this:

## Current Progress

I'm tackling this area by area because otherwise my brain would explode. Since I'm building for mobile, I needed to implement touch controls. This sent me down a ridiculous rabbit hole of pathfinding and walkable areas that took way longer than expected. But hey, it works now!

The absolute nightmare was setting up the tree interaction system. Making trees clickable with visual indicators, programming the wood drops, and coding the collection mechanics nearly broke me. Thank god for Rapid Vectors' tutorial series - though I still managed to mess it up multiple times following step-by-step instructions.

And that's where I'm at. I've hit my mental capacity for today. Will I continue this project tomorrow, or get distracted by a shiny new idea? Place your bets now! :D
