Welp, I've gone and started yet another project. Because apparently finishing games is overrated and my brain just wants the dopamine hit of new ideas.

## How We Got Here

I fell into a nostalgia spiral last weekend. Was watching some Pokémon Red videos, and before I knew it, I was knee-deep in Game Boy emulators. The natural progression was opening Godot and creating a new project folder. This makes, what, the fifth unfinished game this year?

## The Concept

The game is essentially a nostalgic open-world RPG drawing inspiration from both Pokémon and Old School RuneScape. The core elements include:

- Retro pixel graphics with a Game Boy Color aesthetic
- Open world exploration with minimal hand-holding
- Skill progression system (fishing, crafting, etc.) similar to OSRS
- Quest system with some actual narrative depth
- Turn-based combat that remains engaging

It's ambitious for a solo project, but I'm trying to scope it realistically this time.

## Technical Progress So Far

I've been working on the character movement. Getting pixel-perfect movement to feel right takes more effort than expected. Modern engines default to smooth transitions, but I need that grid-based movement that captures the retro feel.

The animation system is coming along. The character sprite moves in four directions with a simple but effective walk cycle. Nothing fancy, just enough to get the point across.

## What's Next

Next steps are building out the state machine and testing all basic functionalities, before mapping out the starting area and implementing the skills framework. Once those core systems are working, I'll have a better sense of the project's viability.

I'll post updates here as things progress. Maybe having a devlog will provide the accountability I need to actually finish this one.

For now, back to debugging.
