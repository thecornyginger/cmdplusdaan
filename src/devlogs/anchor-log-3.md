## Back to the Original Problem

Remember when this was supposed to be a simple workout app? Yeah, me neither. But buried under all my feature creep, the original idea was still there: I wanted something dead simple for tracking workouts without all the motivational garbage that makes me feel worse about myself.

You know those apps with the aggressive streaks, leaderboards, and "BEAST MODE ACTIVATED" notifications? The ones that make you feel like a failure if you miss a day or don't hit some arbitrary personal best? Yeah, those can go straight to app store hell.

I just want to log a few sets, mark them done, and move on with my life. No fanfare, no shame spirals, no competitive pressure.

## The "Habit Breakdown" Rabbit Hole

Most habit trackers treat everything like it's either 100% complete or a total failure. But real life is messier than that. Maybe I did my stretching routine but skipped the strength training. Maybe I meditated for 5 minutes instead of 15. That should still count for *something*, right?

So I built this "Habit Breakdown" feature where you can split habits into components and track them separately. It's basically like sub-items on a to-do list, but baked into the habit tracking system. You can complete parts of your routine without feeling like you failed the whole thing.

## Accidentally Solving My Own Problem

The weird thing is, this actually fixed my original workout tracking problem too. Instead of having one massive "WORKOUT COMPLETE" button that felt overwhelming, I can break it down: warm-up, main sets, cool-down, whatever makes sense.

Some days I'll hit all three components, some days maybe just two. Either way, I'm getting partial credit instead of binary success/failure, which turns out to be way better for my brain.

## The Real Test

Now I just need to actually use this thing consistently enough to see if it works. Because building a habit tracker is one thing, but actually sticking to habits? That's the real challenge.

At least if I fail, I'll have really nice-looking progress bars to show my lack of progress.
