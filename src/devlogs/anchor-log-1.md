## Another Brilliant Idea at 2 AM

So it started innocently enough. I wanted a simple workout app. You know, something to track my "Step by Step" routine without all the bloatware that comes with most fitness apps. Just basic tracking, maybe some progress notes, nothing fancy. 

I actually started building it in Xcode because, you know, when you're on iOS you might as well go native, right? But then while I was implementing the basic workout logging, I had another one of those "helpful" thoughts: "What if I could also track how I felt before and after each workout?" Just a simple mood check-in to see if there were patterns between my mental state and exercise performance.

I then tried some of the existing mood tracking apps, and they all felt... wrong? Too clinical, too focused on daily ratings, not enough context. I wanted something that actually clicked with how my brain works, which apparently is "not like everyone else's."

## The Feature Creep Begins

Of course, once I was thinking about mood tracking, my brain made that dangerous connection: "Hey, you know what else I want to track? Habits. And if I'm tracking habits AND mood AND workouts... why not just build one app that does everything?"

This is exactly the kind of logic that gets me into trouble, but here we are.

## Tech Stack: Because Learning is Fun (Pain)

I'd been playing around with React while building my website, so React Native seemed like the obvious choice. Plus Expo makes everything easier, right? (Narrator: It did not make everything easier.)

The plan was simple: leverage what I already knew, build something clean and minimal, and definitely don't overcomplicate it.

Guess how well that's going.

## What Could Go Wrong?

I'm basically trying to replace three different app categories with one homemade solution, using a framework I've barely touched, while simultaneously learning mobile development patterns. 

But hey, at least when it inevitably becomes a buggy mess, it'll be *my* buggy mess that tracks exactly what I want in exactly the way my brain expects it to work.

Famous last words, probably.
